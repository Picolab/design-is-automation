We've had to retire Jesse's WiFi

Now using a new router, named Whiterun

Lab pico-engine is at 192.168.50.68

To learn this, set your machine to use Whiterun for its WiFi

```
$ nmap 192.168.50.0/24 -sL | grep frog
Nmap scan report for frog (192.168.50.68)
```

Connect monitor, keyboard, and mouse to lab raspberry pi and see what's going on

There is no command window open! So, I don't know why it crashed on Nov. 14

`ps -aux` shows no pico-engine running

Keyboard is in some strange mode and doesn't have either vertical bar nor backslash! AARGH!!!

`pico-engine` starts engine

But engine can't be reached!

On the RPi, reachable as `localhost:8080` but not as `http://192.168.50.68:8080` browser just spins

The reason is that my machine's browser was using `https` (but of course not _showing_ it)

Edited it and it works now

# 5/8/2020 no quad readings since 4/30/2020

Connected to RPi
Terminal window open
Message: terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'

Cannot open a browser because "Faild to fork (Cannot allocate memory)

Last timestamp in pico-engine log "2020-04-30T21:42:09.303Z"

Tried simply `pico-engine`

It ran long enough to accept one event from Wovyn, but ran out of memory again in the same way.

Try `sudo reboot`

Then opened a terminal and did `pico-engine`

Handled a Wovyn event successfully.

Also noted an error message for the ruleset "io.picolabs.google_signin" and flushed it

# 6/28/2021 no quad readings since 6/28/2021 at 2:13:26

Had to install `nmap` on my Macbook

```
$ nmap 192.168.50.0/24 -sL | grep frog
Nmap scan report for frog (192.168.50.68)
```

But it doesn't respond on port 8080. Hooking up a monitor and keyboard... there was not terminal window open.
Looking for file `pico-engine.log`... Found, and last log entry is dated from 6/26 so the pico engine must have crashed?
Verified with `ps -aux` that it is not running.

Launched `pico-engine` command and then tried from a browser on the same subnet:

```
http://192.168.50.68:8080/api/engine-version
{"version":"0.45.6"}
```

and it seems to be running again. Left terminal window open and unplugged display, keyboard, and mouse.

I replaced the batteries, but that might not have been needed. Marking them as such.
