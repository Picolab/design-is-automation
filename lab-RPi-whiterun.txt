We've had to retire Jesse's WiFi

Now using a new router, named Whiterun

Lab pico-engine is at 192.168.50.68

To learn this, set your machine to use Whiterun for its WiFi

```
$ nmap 192.168.50.0/24 -sL | grep frog
Nmap scan report for frog (192.168.50.68)
```

Connect monitor, keyboard, and mouse to lab raspberry pi and see what's going on

There is no command window open! So, I don't know why it crashed on Nov. 14

`ps -aux` shows no pico-engine running

Keyboard is in some strange mode and doesn't have either vertical bar nor backslash! AARGH!!!

`pico-engine` starts engine

But engine can't be reached!

On the RPi, reachable as `localhost:8080` but not as `http://192.168.50.68:8080` browser just spins

The reason is that my machine's browser was using `https` (but of course not _showing_ it)

Edited it and it works now
