Today, visited the manifold.picolabs.io machine and it was at 100% disk usage

Found the pico-engine.log file in ~/.pico-engine and it was over 800M

Removed it

Also removed all of the `forever` log files in ~/.forever

This brought disk usage down to 86%

Note: the pico-engine.log file ended with a query to the smart mirror which logged a very large return string
